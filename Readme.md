### Neural Networks And Deep Learning

The computations of a neural network are organized in terms of a forward pass or forward propagation step, in which we compute the output of the neural network, followed by a backward pass or a backward propagation step which we use to compute gradients or derivatives.__The computation graph explains why it is organized this way.__ <br/>
