## Neural Networks And Deep Learning

The computations of a neural network are organized in terms of a forward pass or forward propagation step, in which we compute the output of the neural network, followed by a backward pass or a backward propagation step which we use to compute gradients or derivatives.__The computation graph explains why it is organized this way.__ <br/>

### Jupyter Notebook
</font>
A Jupyter notebook is a document that allows you to have executable code and text in the same web-page. With Jupyter notebooks you do not have to download anything on your computer to do the programming exercises.<br/>
iPython Notebooks are interactive coding environments embedded in a webpage.<br/>
Numpy is the main package for scientific computing in Python. It is maintained by a large community (www.numpy.org).<br/>
